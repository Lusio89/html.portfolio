<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Luciano Casella, a hospitality professional with a background in bar and restaurant management. My passion for technology and design led me to transition into the world of web development. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Python to build modern and functional websites and applications.</p>

<p>One of my key projects is an app designed to calculate the food cost for restaurants, helping businesses optimize their expenses efficiently.</p>
  
<p>I thrive on challenges and continuous learning, always looking for new opportunities to grow and improve my skills. My goal is to craft digital experiences that are both visually appealing and highly functional.</p>
